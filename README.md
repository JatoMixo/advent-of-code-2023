# Advent of Code 2023
These are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023. They're all made in Rust.
There are solutions for Days from 1 to 6, 8 and the first part of the 12 day.

# To work with it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JatoMixo/advent-of-code-2023.git

# Enter the day you want to see

cargo run # Execute the code

cargo test # Execute the tests (In case I made them)

cargo build --release # Build the release version of the challenge with maximum optimization
```
